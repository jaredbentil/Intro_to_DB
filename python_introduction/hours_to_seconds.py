# Objective: Demonstrate understanding of variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting a given number of hours into seconds.

#Task Description:

#For this task, write a Python script that converts a specific number of hours into seconds. This task reinforces the concept of arithmetic operations within a practical context.

#Instructions:

#Create a file named hours_to_seconds.py.
#Define a variable named hours and assign it a value representing the number of hours you want to convert to seconds. Use hours = 2.
#Calculate the number of seconds in the given hours. Remember, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, thus 60 x 60 = 3600).
#Store the result of the conversion in a variable named seconds.

hours = 2  # Number of hours to convert
seconds = hours * 3600  # Convert hours to seconds
print("2 hour(s)", "is", seconds)  # Output

# The script should output the result in a clear and readable format.
# The expected output should look like this:
