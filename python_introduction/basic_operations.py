# Objective: To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

#Task Description:

#You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

#Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
#Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
#Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.
#Instructions:

#Create a file named basic_operations.py.
#In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
#You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
#Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.


number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations

print("Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", number1 + number2)          # Addition
print("Subtraction of", number1, "and", number2, "is", number1 - number2)       # Subtraction
print("Multiplication of", number1, "and", number2, "is", number1 * number2)       # Multiplication

#end of basic_operations.py
# The script should output the results of the operations in a clear and readable format.
# The expected output should look like this:
# Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
# Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
